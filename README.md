## Tests
To create test, you have to check some parameters. Decide if the grid is deterministe or not, and if it will be a grid or a simple. After, create the file by naming it with "det" or "nondet", "grid" or "simple" and its size.  
Example : det-grid-2x2.data  
Ensure that you can compute his result by yourself and add it in test_output by naming it with the same name excepting the extension ".data". 
Now run `./run_test.sh`
